</div>


<div id="styling3">
<h1>1)Godfrey, First Elden Lord</h1>
<p>Godfrey, the First ELden Lord is one of the final bosses in the game that you must fight to progress in the story. The boss fight can be split into 2 phases. Godfrey has many attacks that deal a lot of damage but are slow so if you can get your timing down, you will be able to dodge them but if you get hit, they'll deal a lot of damage. During the fight, you are allowed to use spirit ashes which if you used properly can make this fight way easier as his A.I. will focus either on you or the spirit ashes when he attacks but not only are spirit ashes allowed, you are also allowed to use multiplayer in the fight meaning you can lower the difficulty of the fight but fighting him with another person. Godfrey has 2 faces. In the first phase, he fights as Godfrey, First Elden Lord but when you get him down to 50% hp, he becames Hoarah Loux. The reason he's first on the list is that the fight with Godfrey is amazing from his lore to his many combo moves to the music of the fight and even the arena, the fight is difficult but a great one nonetheless and is worthy of being an endgame boss for players to fight. Upon defeating him, the player can use his rememberance to craft the Ash of War: Hoarah Loux's Earthshaker or Axe of Godfrey.</p>
<h1>2)Godrick the Grafted</h1>
<p>Godrci kthe Grafted is one of the earliest main bosses you need to fight. The first time you see Godrick, he looks  amazing as a character. He has many arms on his body and legs that were grafted into his body and he looks intimidating and scary to new players. He has attacks for close range, long range, and some aoe attacks that will give new players a challenge. When you get Godrick to half health, he will cut off his arm and replace it with a dragon head. Not only is he amazing, the whole arena is amazing as well. The arnea is like a graveyard with many tomobstone but on one side, there is the literal corpse of a dragon just there which Godrick replaces one of his hands with its head. The fight helps playrs to learn how to use the environemnt to their advantage as you can user the tombstones and the trees in the arena to help block and dodge his long range attacks. IF you want to make the fight easier, you can also use multiplayer and spirit ashes in the fight. Players can use his remembrance to craft the axe of Godrick or the grafted dragon.</p>
<h1>3)Malenia, Blade of Miquella</h1>
<p>Malenia, blade of Miquella is one of the hardest and most annoying boss fights in the game but don't get me wrong, it's still a beuitufl fight nonetheless. The arena of flowers are beutiful, her attack patterns and combos are hard to deal with and complex but with practice, you will learn to dodge them which helps remind the players that strategy is key in this game. the Reason she is ranked 3rd is because of what makes her annoying which are how some of her attacks inflict scarlet rot which is annoying in its own right to deal with but its that she can life steal from the player when she deals damage which combined with her complex and hard to dodge attacks, is a bad combination that makes the fight more and more annoying as players need to focus not on their health, but to make sure that they don't get hit in the first place so that she doesn't get her health back. Spirit ashes and multipla Upon defeat, players will be able to use spirit ashes and multiplayer in the fight. Upon defeat, players can use her rememberance to get the incantation Scarlet Aeonia or the weapon Hand of Malenia. </p>
<h1>4)Margit, the Fell Omen</h1>
<p>Margit the Fell Omen is a boss players fight before they fight Godrick, the Grafted. He's the first main boss you fight in the game. As a first</p>
<h1>5)Starscourge Radahn</h1>
